<h2>preface</h2>
<p>
  the purpose of this document is to audit popular website builders to see if
  they have any ties with Israel (in line with the philosophies of the
  <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds">bds movement</a>). i have
  chosen website builders that i have used in the past that are popular, there
  are some missing. let me know if you'd like me to audit one that's not on
  here.
</p>
<p>
  in this page i will keep things straight to the point, and try my best to
  provide all the facts that i'm aware of.
</p>
<h2>website builders</h2>
<h3>wix</h3>
<p>
  Wix is an Israeli software company founded by Avishai Abrahami, Nadav
  Abrahami and Giora Kaplan in 2006, based in Tel Aviv. it has it's main
  office in Tel Aviv, with other offices in Israel as well
  <a href="https://www.wix.com/about/us">Beer Sheba, Haifa</a>. they've

  in this most recent october 2023 conflict. it's also been

    >leaked in internal chats</a>
  that they've encouraged their “employees to create content supporting
  'Israel's narrative' in the country's conflict with Hamas militants in
  Gaza”.
</p>
<h3>squarespace</h3>
<p>
  Squarespace is an American software company founded by Anthony Casalena in
  2004, based in New York City. Squarespace offers many unique features
  integrated right into their platform that other website builders don't have,
  like
  <a
    href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206779077-Getting-started-with-Squarespace-Commerce"
    >Squarespace Commerce</a>. Squarespace Commerce “is a set of features for selling products and
  managing orders online. By connecting a payment processor, you can process
  credit card transactions, accept PayPal, issue refunds, and receive
  donations.”
</p>
<p>
  looking further into Squarespace Commerce, specifically the payment
  processor, it can only work for the user if their local currency is
  supported. in their article
  <a
    href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205811248-Supported-countries-and-currencies-for-Squarespace-Commerce"
    >Supported countries and currencies for Squarespace Commerce</a>
  (which was most recently updated on october 5, 2023), it shows that that the
  “Israeli shekel (ILS)” is listed as a supported currency on Squarespace.
</p>
<p>
  this indicates that Squarespace is in support of merchants and businesses
  that use their platform in Israel.
</p>
<h3>wordpress</h3>
<p>
  Wordpress is a web CMS (content management system) founded by Matt Mullenweg
  and Mike Little. It was released in 2003 and is notably free and open-source
  software, meaning that you can use it without having to pay anything
  anywhere in the world. Furthermore, this means Wordpress is not owned by any
  company. But it is heavily supported by some organizations.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/">Wordpress Foundation</a> “is
  a charitable organization founded by Matt Mullenweg to further the mission
  of the WordPress open source project: to democratize publishing through Open
  Source, GPL software.” There is also
  <a href="https://automattic.com/about/">Automattic</a>, a private company
  founded by Matt Mullenweg which is “a distributed company with 1,935
  Automatticians in 95 countries speaking 119 different languages. We're
  committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and our common goal is to
  democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it,
  and anyone with a product can sell it, regardless of income, gender,
  politics, language, or where they live in the world.” There is nothing I
  could find to indicate ties with Israel.
</p>
<p>
  Something worth noting though is that Wordpress allows people to
  <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/">create plugins</a> to
  integrate into their Wordpress website. Those plugins do not mean that they
  are a core part of Wordpress, nor that they come from the original
  developers. Anyone can develop a plugin, and it is not required for anyone
  else to download it. So if you want to use a plugin, make sure to audit that
  plugin to make sure it doesn't have ties with Israel.
</p>
<h3>webflow</h3>
<p>
  Webflow is a website building American company founded by Vlad Magdalin,
  Sergie Magdalin, and Bryant Chou in 2013. There are seemingly no direct ties
  with Israel through Webflow.
</p>
<h3>shopify</h3>
<p>
  Shopify is a Canadian multinational e-commerce company that runs the same
  name (Shopify) proprietary e-commerce platform, founded by Tobias Lütke and
  Scott Lake in 2006. The Shopify platform allows people to run online stores
  and POS systems. It has a whole suite of features, including payments,
  marketing, shipping, and much more.
</p>
<p>
  Again, a major feature on the Shopify platform is
  <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments"
    >Shopify Payments</a>. In Shopify's words, it “is the simplest way to accept payments online. It
  eliminates the hassle of setting up a third-party payment provider or
  merchant account and having to enter the credentials into Shopify.” Unlike
  Squarespace, Shopify Payments
  <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/supported-countries">does not have Israel as a supported country</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Besides Shopify Payments, Shopify also has an official
  <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/">app store</a> that allows their online
  stores to add third-party plugins, that extends the functionality of the
  core Shopify platform. Similar to Wordpress' plugins, these apps are not
  directly created by Shopify, nor are they a core part of Shopify (they are
  not required). But unlike Wordpress, they need to go through a thorough
  <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review">app review process</a>
  in order to be officially supported on their app store. This means that
  Shopify has direct control of what is allowed to be shown on their app
  store. Looking through the app store, one can easily find apps that are in
  support of Israel / Israeli merchants that use Shopify (examples:
  <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/stand-with-israel">We Stand with Israel</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/hfd-integration">HFD DeliverIt</a>,
  <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/deliver-via-shipos">Ship OS</a>).
</p>
<h3>weebly</h3>
<p>
  Weebly is an American web hosting and web development company founded by
  David Rusenko, Dan Veltri, and Chris Fanini in 2006. It was acquired by
  Square, Inc. (now known as Block, Inc.) in 2018. There are seemingly no
  direct ties with Israel through Weebly, or any of the subsidiaries of Block,
  Inc. (Weebly's parent company).
</p>
